                        <li>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</li>
                        <p>We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, etc.) from you when you set up a free account with evonexpay.com. While you can browse some sections of our site without being a registered member, certain activities (such as ecurrency swap, trading etc) do require registration. We do use your contact information to send you offers based on your previous orders and your interests.</p>
                        <li>Use of Demographic and Profile Data</li>
                        <p>We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the extent we use your personal information to connect people to you, we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses.

Those entities and affiliates may not market to you as a result of such sharing unless you explicitly opt-in.</p>
                        <p>We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. We may disclose personal information to law enforcement offices, third party rights owners, or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms or Privacy Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a third party; or protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general public.</p>
